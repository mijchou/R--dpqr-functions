# R--dpqr-functions

You may have overseen the functions dnorm, pnorm, qnorm & rnorm in R. They all seem to be associated with the normal distribution in some ways... but what exactly do they actually do & how do they all differ to each others? In this repository I will make a short explanation of the basic usage of dpqr functions - with simple simulations on the normal distribution. For design and implementation of the functions, please refer to my other repository Mandelbrot-Distribution-Function.

## What is a distribution?

## dnorm - probability density function (pdf)

## pnorm - probaility cumulative function (cdf)

## qnorm - quantile function

## rnorm - random number generator
