# R--dpqr-functions

You may have overseen the functions dnorm, pnorm, qnorm & rnorm in R. They all seem to be associated with the normal distribution in some ways... but what exactly do they actually do & how do they all differ to each others? In this repository I will make a short explanation of the basic usage of dpqr functions - with simple simulations on the normal distribution. For further design and implementation of the functions, please refer to my other repository [Mandelbrot-Distribution-Function](https://github.com/mijchou/Mandelbrot-Distribution-Function).

## What is a distribution function?


## dnorm - probability density function (pdf)

## pnorm - probaility cumulative function (cdf)

## qnorm - quantile function

## rnorm - random number generator
